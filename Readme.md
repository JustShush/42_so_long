## üéÆ Running
Run the executable file followed by a valid map file, at the root of the `so_long` directory. Example:
```Shell
$ ./so_long maps/map1.ber
```

### Using your own map files

You can run the game with a custom map file as long as it follows the <a href="https://github.com/WudDoo/so_long#-game-rules">Game Rules</a>.

<br>

## üìù Game Rules

The executable so_long will receive a map as the only argument, and this map must have a `.ber` filetype.

The file also must follow these rules:

* The only accepted characters are:
	* `P` (player)
	* `1` (wall)
	* `0` (empty)
	* `C` (collectible)
	* `E` (exit)

* The map must be rectangular, i.e. all rows must have the same length
* There must be only one exit and one player, and at least one collectible in the map
* The map must be surrounded by walls
* There must be a valid path the player can take from the starting position, to the exit, collecting all colletibles.

<br>

If any of these checks fail, the game will end with `Error\n` followed by a custom message.

The goal is for the player( to collect all the collectibles on the map before going to an exit in the least possible number of steps
